<br><br>

Different Ways to Tell If a Pearl is Real 
<br><br>
By Hand 
The best part about testing pearls is that you've got pearls in your hands! Now first, rub them together. If there is friction the pearls are real. It means there is calcium, a key ingredient in pearls. If they just slip off each other, sorry, they are fake.
<br><br>
The Tooth Test 
Another way to test if a pearl is real is by rubbing a pearl against your tooth. If there is a gritty feeling, then the pearl is real. The grit you feel is, of course, the calcium. 
<br><br>
Magnification 
As is true with diamonds, magnification reveals a lot about the quality of a pearl. You can see the characteristic ridges and irregularities of real pearls or the grainy smoothness of fakes. You can examine drill holes to see the interface between the nacre and what lies beneath it. You can read any writing on the clasp or setting.
<br><br>
Density 
Density is the mass of an object as a function of its volume. Real pearls are heavier for their size than plastic, resin, or hollow glass pearls. Good glass fakes will have the same density are real pearls. Light pearls are fake - you can't tell real from faux on the basis of density alone if the pearls are heavy. 

<br><br>

How to Care for Pearls
To protect the surface of your pearls, put them on after your beauty routine. It is important to avoid contact with hairspray and perfume. 
To maintain luster, occasionally wipe with a soft, damp cloth. 
To avoid scratches, store separately in a soft cloth. 
To keep them from drying out, wear them often. Pearls love the oils from your skin.

<a href="gallery4.htm">Semi Precious Stone Collection</a><br>
<br>


XS Bling Semi Precious Stone collection is 100% hand made with semi precious stone such as Crystal, Jade, Turquoise, Agate, Marble etc. Collection includes Necklace, Bracelets, Earrings and Accessories.
<br><br>

<span class="subtitle2">Semi Precious Stone Knowledge:</span>
<ul class="solutionsmargin">
<li>Crystal
A crystal or crystalline solid is a solid material, whose constituent atoms, molecules, or ions are arranged in an orderly repeating pattern extending in all three spatial dimensions. The scientific study of crystals and crystal formation is crystallography. The process of crystal formation via mechanisms of crystal growth is called crystallization or solidification.
<br><br>
<li>Jade
Jade is an ornamental stone. The term jade is applied to two different metamorphic rocks that are made up of different silicate minerals:
<br><br>
Nephrite consists of a microcrystaline interlocking fibrous matrix of the calcium, magnesium-iron rich amphibole mineral series tremolite(calcium-magnesium)-ferroactinolite (calcium-magnesium-iron). The middle member of this series with an intermediate composition is called actinolite (the silky fibrous mineral form is one form of asbestos). The higher the iron content the greener the colour.
<br><br>
Jadeite is a sodium- and aluminium-rich pyroxene. The gem form of the mineral is a microcrystaline interlocking crystal matrix.
<br><br>
<li>Turquoise
Turquoise is an opaque, blue-to-green mineral that is a hydrous phosphate of copper and aluminium, with the chemical formulaCuAl6(PO4)4(OH)8¡¤4H2O. It is rare and valuable in finer grades and has been prized as a gem and ornamental stone for thousands of years owing to its unique hue. In recent times turquoise, like most other opaque gems, has been devalued by the introduction of treatments, imitations, and synthetics onto the market.
<br><br>
<li>Agate
Agate is a microcrystalline variety of quartz (silica), chiefly chalcedony, characterised by its fineness of grain and brightness of color. Although agates may be found in various kinds of rock, they are classically associated with volcanic rocks but can be common in certain metamorphic rocks.Colorful agates and other chalcedonies were obtained over 3,000 years ago from the Achates River, now called Dirillo, in Sicily.
<br><br>
<li>Marble
Marble is a non foliated metamorphic rock resulting from the metamorphism of limestone, composed mostly of calcite (a crystalline form of calcium carbonate, CaCO3).
